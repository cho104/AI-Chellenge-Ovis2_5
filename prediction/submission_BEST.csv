Shadows of centuries still they grow space. While mystery hovers over the world, Where is the God of Teotihuacan? O souls that cross again the yawning deep, While round these monuments the lizards creep, I feel your ghostly contact as you keep your vigils in old Teotihuacan. O spirit guardians of this grim terrain, Has karma bound us with the same chain. Did I too, worship at that grave fane, Long years ago, in Teotihuacan?""

Then find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 9 outcomes / 6 outcomes = 3/2 = 1.5 = 150%
Then subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to find the difference: 50% - 150% = -100%

1682,"Medicare Home Infusion Site of Care Act of 2014 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to provide for Medicare coverage of home infusion therapy. Defines &quot;home infusion therapy&quot; as the items and services provided by a qualified home infusion therapy supplier under a plan established and periodically reviewed by a physician, which are provided in an integrated manner in the individual's home in conformance with uniform standards of care established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and in coordination with the provision of covered infusion drugs under part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program). Requires the Secretary to establish such standards after taking into account the standards commonly used for home infusion therapy by Medicare Advantage plans and in the private sector and after consultation with all interested stakeholders. Includes among the items and services provided: (1) professional services, including nursing services, provided in accordance with the plan and all necessary supplies and equipment; and (2) other items and services the Secretary determines appropriate to administer infusion drug therapies to an individual safely and effectively in the home. Directs the Secretary to determine a per diem schedule for payment for the professional services, supplies, and equipment for each infusion therapy type that reflects the reasonable costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated qualified home infusion therapy suppliers to provide such services, supplies, and equipment in conformity with applicable state and federal laws, regulations, and the uniform quality and safety standards developed under this Act and to assure that Medicare beneficiaries have reasonable access to such therapy. Requires the Secretary to update such schedule from year to year by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers for the 12-month period ending with June of the preceding year. Allows the Secretary to modify the per diem schedule with respect to beneficiaries who qualify for home infusion therapy services but who receive nursing services as home health services.

Applies accreditation requirements to the accreditation of qualified home infusion therapy suppliers in the same way as they apply to other suppliers. Provides for Medicare coverage of infusion drugs administered via an intravenous, intraspinal, intra-arterial, intrathecal, epidural, subcutaneous, or intramuscular access device or injection. Requires the Secretary to implement the Medicare home infusion therapy benefit under the amendments made by this Act in a manner that ensures that Medicare beneficiaries have timely and appropriate access to infusion therapy in their homes and that there is rapid and seamless coordination between drug coverage under part D and coverage for home infusion therapy services under part B to avoid the filing of duplicative or otherwise improper claims.
